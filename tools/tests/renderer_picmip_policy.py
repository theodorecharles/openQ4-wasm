"""Pins the diffuse-only picmip contract across the image pipeline.

openQ4 reduces textures in three separate loaders (raw 2D, cube, precompressed
DDS) and caches the result in generated .bimage files. A picmip that is applied
in one loader but not another, or that is not folded into the cache key, shows
up as a texture stuck at the wrong size long after the cvar changed. These
checks keep the single-policy shape that prevents that.
