"""Contract checks for openQ4 cel shading.

Two things are pinned here. First, the band ladder: the CPU helper, the three
interaction shaders and this file all have to agree on where a band boundary
falls, because a mismatch would show up as models and world geometry stepping at
different intensities. Second, the wiring: which surfaces participate, where the
passes sit in the frame, and what the feature degrades to when a backend cannot
carry part of it.
