"""Contract checks for the openQ4 multiplayer player visibility overlays.

Three effects share one backend pass: an additive brightskin wash, an additive
rimlight, and a silhouette outline shell. What is pinned here is the part that is
easy to break and impossible to notice from a single screenshot.

The outline shell's extrusion is checked as arithmetic rather than as tokens. Its
job is to hold a constant pixel width, and the offset it applies is built from a
clip-space quantity and two per-pixel scales, so it is entirely possible to write
a version that is the right length and still points the wrong way. That failure
is invisible at 16:9 and obvious at 32:9, which is exactly the kind of thing a
test should catch instead of a bug report from someone with a wide monitor.

The rest pins the wiring: which surfaces may grow a shell, how the two depth
groups keep out of each other's silhouette mask, what the see-through flag now
covers, and that the pass hands the stencil back the way the frame expects it.
