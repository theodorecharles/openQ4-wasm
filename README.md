## What is openQ4?

**openQ4** is an open-source replacement for the Quake 4 engine and game binaries, built to keep the original game playable on modern PCs while improving presentation, audio, controls, packaging, and day-to-day usability.

It is designed for players who want the original Quake 4 experience with a cleaner path to running it on today's hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> openQ4 does **not** include Quake 4 assets. You still need a legitimate Quake 4 copy from Steam or GOG.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am getting the question a lot - particularly in the past week or two (Aug 2026) - so I feel I need to emphasise this point now: **openQ4 is not compatible with legacy Quake 4 game code**. This includes the recent Awakening leak by Justin Marshall. This position won't (and cannot) change. An Awakening mod for openQ4 isn't off the cards, however.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Another point to make, as sadly luddites have become more common rather than less in 2026 and certainly more vocal than ever. Yes, this software is mostly vibe coded and with the extensive work that has gone into it it wouldn't be humanly possible to achieve without a small studio. That does not mean it isn't thoroughly checked and tested by multiple people, it also doesn't mean it is unsafe for use, nor does it mean we don't understand the codebase. It does have a few remaining issues to iron out - remaining macOS support being the main one - but as feedback will show it is otherwise stable. Whether you choose to follow unsubstantiated claims by luddites is entirely up to you, but I would first take a moment to examine their track records before presuming their expertise and credibility on the matter.

## Why players use openQ4

- **Modern display support** for widescreen, ultrawide, multi-monitor, borderless, and fullscreen setups.
- **Optional visual upgrades** such as bloom, HDR, anti-aliasing, baked light grids, soft particles, and enhanced shadow options.
- **OpenAL audio** restored to the pre-plan compatibility path by default, with newer voice handling revalidated behind an opt-in gate.
- **Improved input and quality-of-life features** including controller support, better console UX, and modern settings behavior.
- **Single-player and multiplayer in one install** with active compatibility work aimed at the stock game.
- **A stock-map Arena Campaign** (experimental) with five escalating bot tiers, varied combat game types, boss matches, and persistent ladder progress beside the original story.
- **A unified demo library and player** with pause, speed, stepping, rewind/fast-forward controls, honest legacy-format status, and full-world free-fly/player-follow playback for server-side multi-view recordings.
- **Cross-platform support** with Windows packages, directly executable Linux AppImages and archives for x86_64 plus preview aarch64, Steam Deck support on Linux, and experimental Apple Silicon/arm64 macOS OpenGL/Metal bridge packages through the signed/notarized DMG lane for credentialed release runs.
- **Open development** with releases, issue tracking, and community feedback all happening in public.

## System requirements

You need a legitimate Quake 4 install plus the openQ4 package that matches your operating system and CPU architecture.

| Tier | Practical target |
|---|---|
| **Minimum** | 64-bit CPU, 4 GB RAM, a working OpenGL compatibility driver with ARB2-era vertex/fragment program support, and about 12 GB free for the openQ4 package plus retail Quake 4 assets. Use the `minimum` or `lowpower` performance preset on constrained systems. |
| **Recommended** | Modern quad-core CPU, 8 GB RAM, OpenGL 4.1+ compatibility-class GPU with 2 GB+ VRAM, current graphics drivers, and 15 GB+ free. For high resolutions, `quality`, or `ultra`, 16 GB RAM and 6 GB+ VRAM gives much better headroom. |

Packaged support currently focuses on Windows, Linux x64, Steam Deck/SteamOS, preview Linux ARM64, and experimental Apple Silicon/arm64 macOS. Linux ARM64 requires a desktop OpenGL compatibility driver and remains preview until real-hardware Wayland gameplay, audio, and input signoff is accepted. See the [Getting Started guide](docs/user/getting-started.md#system-requirements) for the platform-specific requirements and caveats.

> **Renderer backends:** OpenGL remains the default and recommended release renderer on every platform. The **Vulkan** backend is **experimental and opt-in** (`r_renderApi vulkan`, applied on engine restart), but now renders the stock Quake 4 material-program families, including environment and heat-haze effects, displacement and depth/blur post effects, and guide-driven parallax, custom-lighting, water, and refractive-glass stages. Vulkan also supports 4x MSAA with SMAA. On Windows and Linux it drives a Vulkan driver directly. Apple ships no Vulkan driver, so on experimental macOS the same module runs on top of **MoltenVK**, a Vulkan-on-Metal translation layer bundled inside both existing macOS packages — a runtime option rather than a third download, and not a Metal renderer. Broader parity and platform validation are still in progress, so visual artifacts or instability remain possible; an initialization failure falls back safely to OpenGL. See [Display Settings → Renderer Backend](docs/user/display-settings.md#renderer-backend-opengl-default-vulkan-is-experimental).

## Quick start

1. Install **Quake 4** from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2210/Quake_4/) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/quake_4).
2. Download the latest openQ4 build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/releases).
3. On Linux, make the matching `x86_64` or `aarch64` AppImage executable and launch it; for an extracted archive, launch `openQ4-client_<arch>` (or `openQ4-steamdeck` on Steam Deck).
4. If openQ4 does not find your Quake 4 install automatically, follow the path setup notes in the [Getting Started guide](docs/user/getting-started.md).

## Compatibility at a glance

- openQ4 targets the **official Quake 4 retail assets**.
- It ships its **own engine and game modules**.
- It is **not** a drop-in runtime for the original proprietary Quake 4 DLL mods.
- The project is still in **beta development**, so compatibility work is ongoing.

If you run into problems, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/issues) and include crash logs or setup details when possible. For experimental macOS crashes, use the [macOS support-data guide](docs/user/macos-support-data.md) before filing or updating an issue.
