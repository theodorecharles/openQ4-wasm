# GL Renderer Modernization

openQ4 now has the first GL-only foundation for the high-performance renderer redesign. This milestone does not replace the ARB2 renderer yet; it adds the capability, selection, telemetry, compatibility bridge, and opt-in modern-executor preparation path that later GL 3.3/4.x draw execution will use.

## Runtime Tiers

`r_glTier` selects the requested OpenGL tier:

- `auto` keeps the compatibility bridge safe by default while probing the full driver capability set.
- `legacy` forces the GL2-style compatibility survival path.
- `gl33`, `gl41`, `gl43`, `gl45`, and `gl46` request modern tier selection. On the SDL3 backend these forced modern values use the core-profile context ladder first.

The internal tier names are:

- `LegacyGL2Compat`
- `ModernGL33`
- `ModernGL41`
- `GpuDrivenGL43`
- `LowOverheadGL45`
- `TopGL46`
- `NullRenderer`

Metal and Vulkan are intentionally out of scope for this track. The native Vulkan renderer has its own module-based track in [plans/2026-07-16-vulkan-renderer.md](plans/2026-07-16-vulkan-renderer.md), selected with `r_renderApi` and failing closed onto the GL path described here.

`gfxInfo` also prints `Renderer tier contract:`. That line is the quick audit for whether the selected tier has the workload model it claims:

- `selectedReady` says the selected tier can run its own contract.
- `requestedReady` says a forced `r_glTier` request was met exactly.
- `degraded` and `failClosed` explain forced-tier fallback when the driver cannot satisfy the requested tier.
- `baseline`, `gl41`, `gpuDriven`, `lowOverhead`, and `top` show which workload rungs are genuinely active.
- `cpuWorkload` and `gpuWorkload` separate GL 3.3/4.1 CPU-managed paths from GL 4.3+ GPU-driven paths.
- `missing` lists concise blockers such as `ubo`, `mrt`, `compute`, `buffer-storage`, `gl-spirv`, `rollback`, or `requested-tier`.

Use `rendererTierContractSelfTest` alongside `rendererTierSelfTest` when changing tier selection, capability probing, or renderer workload gates.

## Default Promotion

The visible default remains conservative. `r_glTier auto` can select a modern-capable tier after capability probing, but the automatic visible path stays on the ARB2 compatibility bridge unless every default-promotion gate passes, `r_rendererPromotionEvidence` contains the Phase 8 validation token, and `r_rendererModernAutoPromote 1` is explicitly set after release sign-off.

Default promotion requires:

- `r_glTier auto`, not a forced modern or legacy tier.
- `r_renderer best`, so explicit `r_renderer arb2` remains a rollback escape.
- a selected modern GL 3.3+ tier with baseline gates passing after driver quirks are applied.
- a live modern executor and the ARB2 bridge still available as an escape hatch.
- `r_rendererPromotionEvidence` carrying the complete Phase 8 token: `phase8=complete;warnings=0;visual=pass;gameplay=pass;renderdoc=pass;perf=arb2-or-better;presentation=pass;rollback=pass;debug=off`.
- completed deterministic visual checks, required SP/MP gameplay, RenderDoc tier captures, ARB2-or-better benchmark captures, high-refresh presentation checks, rollback checks, and debug-off validation on target hardware.

`gfxInfo` prints `Renderer default promotion:` with active/eligible state, evidence coverage, missing evidence fields, and the current blocking reason. `rendererDefaultPromotionSelfTest` covers missing evidence, incomplete evidence, evidence-ready unsigned promotion, signed promotion, explicit ARB2 escape, forced legacy tier, compatibility-gate block, and missing-legacy-escape block. `r_rendererModernVisible 1` remains the manual opt-in for targeted bring-up; `r_rendererModernAutoPromote 1` is the release sign-off switch that lets `r_glTier auto` request that guarded visible path automatically only when the evidence token is complete.

`gfxInfo` also prints `Renderer default safety:`. That line is the clean-startup audit for Phase 13: `r_renderer best` or explicit `r_renderer arb2`, `r_glTier auto`, auto-promotion disabled, ARB2 rollback available, and all modern executor, submit, visible, debug, validation, bindless, and shader-reload side paths off unless explicitly requested. `rendererDefaultSafetySelfTest` validates that contract before release candidates or benchmark claims are made.

## Cross-Platform Context Ladder

openQ4 now builds context candidates from one shared renderer-side ladder instead of keeping per-platform arrays. Windows SDL3, Linux SDL3, native Linux/GLX, and native macOS/NSOpenGL all record the selected request in `glConfig.contextRequest`, and `gfxInfo` prints both requested and actual debug-context state.

Forced modern tiers prefer the requested compatibility-profile tier first, then lower compatibility-profile tiers, then the unversioned compatibility fallback, with core-profile candidates retained only as a final diagnostic fallback:

1. `gl46`: `4.6 compatibility`, `4.5 compatibility`, `4.3 compatibility`, `4.1 compatibility`, `3.3 compatibility`, compatibility fallback, then matching core fallbacks
2. `gl45`: `4.5 compatibility`, `4.3 compatibility`, `4.1 compatibility`, `3.3 compatibility`, compatibility fallback, then matching core fallbacks
3. `gl43`: `4.3 compatibility`, `4.1 compatibility`, `3.3 compatibility`, compatibility fallback, then matching core fallbacks
4. `gl41`: `4.1 compatibility`, `3.3 compatibility`, compatibility fallback, then matching core fallbacks
5. `gl33`: `3.3 compatibility`, compatibility fallback, then `3.3 core`

The default `auto` path and forced modern tiers both prefer versioned compatibility profiles because the current visible shipping executor is still the ARB2 compatibility bridge. This avoids regressing stock rendering while the modern executor is being promoted pass by pass. The shared ladder also has a modern-auto mode covered by self-test for the point where the visible renderer no longer needs the compatibility bridge.

`r_glDebugContext 1` now expands the ladder rather than making startup all-or-nothing: each requested debug candidate is followed by the same non-debug candidate if the platform or driver rejects debug contexts. macOS skips debug candidates explicitly because NSOpenGL does not expose debug-context creation. macOS also skips 4.3+ core requests and continues at the highest supported OpenGL profile, 4.1 core.

Use `rendererContextLadderSelfTest` to validate the table-driven ladder contract without entering gameplay.

## Capability Probe

The new capability probe records exact version/profile data and feature flags for:

- UBOs, VAOs, instancing, texture arrays, MRT/FBO support
- timer queries, sync objects, map-buffer-range
- buffer storage, direct state access, multi-bind
- compute shaders, SSBOs, draw indirect, multi-draw indirect
- texture views, GL SPIR-V, bindless texture availability

Extension parsing is token-safe and uses `glGetStringi` when available, with legacy string parsing only as fallback.

## Upload Bridge

Vertex-cache uploads now route through the renderer upload manager before falling back to the original legacy paths. This keeps the public `idVertexCache` API unchanged while moving both long-lived static vertex/index buffers and dynamic GUI, deform, packed-surface, and interaction-prep uploads onto renderer-owned allocation/upload code.

The upload layer is split into three pieces:

- `BufferAllocator` owns static VBO creation, data upload, deletion, and live static-buffer accounting for `idVertexCache::Alloc`.
- `RingBuffer` owns per-frame offsets, alignment, high-water, and overflow tracking for dynamic uploads.
- `UploadManager` selects the live GL upload path, owns the multi-buffered frame stream, retires sync fences, records static and dynamic upload metrics, and keeps `LegacyStreamBuffer` as the compatibility fallback/accounting path.

The dynamic stream is feature-gated:

- GL 4.4+/`ARB_buffer_storage` uses persistent mapped buffers when `r_rendererUploadPersistent 1`.
- GL 3.x+/`ARB_map_buffer_range` uses map-range streaming.
- Older VBO-capable paths use orphaned `glBufferSubData` streaming.
- If the upload stream is unavailable or overflows, the old vertex-cache fallback remains active for compatibility.

`r_rendererUploadMegs` controls the per-frame upload-stream size. The stream keeps multiple frame buffers and uses GL sync objects when available before reusing one. `gfxInfo` reports whether the frame stream and static-buffer allocator are enabled, which path was selected, the ring size, live static-buffer ownership, and whether persistent mapping is active. `r_rendererMetrics` reports static upload bytes/allocations, live static buffers, frame-ring high-water/overflow data, and persistent/map-range/subdata dynamic writes.

Use `rendererUploadSelfTest` to run the ring, allocator, and static-buffer tests in a live build.

## Metrics

`r_rendererMetrics` controls renderer telemetry:

- `0`: off
- `1`: periodic frame summary
- `2`: per-frame command, packet, and graph detail

The metrics layer records front-end time, visibility time, scene-packet build time, render-graph build time, submit time, back-end time, present/swap time, view/entity/light counts, draw/surface/vertex/index counts, upload bytes, buffer stalls, upload-stream high-water/overflow data, scene-packet counts, packet material/resource/geometry/instance coverage, packet category and sort-key validation counters, packet-driven render-graph counts, modern-executor preparation coverage, modern shader-library readiness, modern draw-plan coverage, modern submit-plan readiness, modern clustered-light readiness, modern deferred-resolve readiness, modern forward+ readiness, modern visible-frame readiness, and selected renderer tier.

`r_rendererGpuTimers 1` samples GL timer queries when `r_rendererMetrics` is enabled and the driver exposes timer-query support. Samples are resolved on a delayed, nonblocking path; unavailable results are reported as `not-sampled` or dropped instead of stalling the CPU. Detail mode reports resolved GPU timing for the current compatibility backend command categories:

- 3D views
- 2D/GUI views
- render-target operations
- copy-render operations
- special effects
- buffer switches
- swap/present

Use `rendererGpuTimerSelfTest` to verify live timer-query support. `gfxInfo` reports whether renderer GPU timers are available and whether the cvar is enabled.

Metrics now also include the front-end scene-packet stream, resource-backed render graph, graph resource owner, modern GL executor path, modern clustered-light data model, deferred-lite resolve bridge, clustered forward+ bridge, visible-frame composition bridge, modern GL state-cache counters, and benchmark capture summaries. Completed `RenderWorld` views emit `ScenePacket`, `PassPacket`, and `DrawPacket` records after portal/area/scissor culling, surface extraction, special-effect surface submission, subview generation, and draw-surface sorting. Full-screen GUI views emit the same packet contract from the GUI model builder. Draw packets carry legacy sort keys, material records, first bump/diffuse/specular stage images where available, geometry counts, scissor data, shader-register availability, and cache availability. The old ARB2 command-stream translator remains as a backend fallback for direct legacy command flushes, but normal frames report `packets=frontend` in `r_rendererMetrics`. The render graph now preserves ordered packet-pass nodes and attaches explicit virtual resources such as `sceneColor`, `sceneDepth`, G-buffer attachments, `deferredLight`, `hybridSceneColor`, `postA`, `backBuffer`, and imported light-grid/cluster data. It records per-pass read/write/clear/resolve/invalidate/present edges, transient/imported resource counts, first/last resource lifetimes, and aliasable transient groups while ARB2 still owns visible pass execution by default. When `r_rendererModernExecutor 1` is enabled on a GL 3.3+ capable tier, the modern executor consumes that packet/graph data, keeps a starter VAO plus frame-constants UBO alive, validates the internal shader-library variants, builds a draw plan with program selections and state-batch counts, derives a submit plan from vertex/index cache state, builds CPU clustered-light records and UBOs for the hybrid-lighting milestones, can resolve the G-buffer subset into graph-owned deferred lighting, can submit graph-backed clustered forward+ opaque/alpha/transparent side-path draws, can compose a controlled modern visible frame from `deferredLight` and `sceneColor` through graph-owned `hybridSceneColor`, updates the frame UBO once per backend frame through the shared `GLStateCache`, and reports prepared pass/draw/plan/submit/cluster/deferred/forward+/visible-frame coverage. When `r_rendererModernSubmit 1` is also enabled, the executor issues diagnostic GL 3.3 draw calls before the legacy backend runs while masking color/depth writes so ARB2 remains the visible renderer.

`RendererBenchmarks` is the Phase 16 capture layer over the metrics stream. `rendererBenchmarkCapture` prints the latest frame sample plus rolling P50/P95/P99 frame-time percentiles, active benchmark preset, CPU and GPU pass timings, upload/draw/light/cluster/fallback counts, and threshold pass/fail state. `r_rendererBenchmarkPreset` selects low, baseline, modern, or high-end budgets for screen percentage, cluster-grid dimensions, material/light batch targets, shadow resolution/update rate, post-process quality, and default P95/P99 targets. `r_rendererPerfThresholdP95` and `r_rendererPerfThresholdP99` allow local target-machine overrides. The clustered-light builder now uses those budgets as its baseline grid policy, and `r_rendererAdaptiveClusterGrid` lets it respond further to measured viewport size and light pressure; `r_rendererDynamicResolution` is currently an opt-in reporting hook so fixed-resolution parity remains the baseline.

`RenderGraphResources` turns the virtual graph into real GL-owned resource handles while ARB2 remains visible. It imports the back buffer, legacy scene color/depth, and light-grid data; allocates transient texture/FBO pairs for scene depth, scene color, and post targets; validates FBO completeness; tracks first/last pass lifetimes, alias groups, and physical allocation ids; and exposes `rendererRenderGraphResourceSelfTest` plus `rendererRenderGraphResourceDump`. Modern HDR-capable tiers allocate scene color, deferred light, hybrid scene color, post, emissive, and translucent-shadow moment color resources as FP16 targets; baseline fallback tiers keep RGBA8 so older GL paths stay viable. Detailed metrics report graph invalidates and `graphGL(...)` prepared/handle/physical/FBO status.

`MaterialResourceTable` turns packet material records into stable backend-facing material ids. Each entry records the source material id/name/class, blend and sort group, alpha-test state, shader-register ranges, first bump/diffuse/specular/emissive/GUI/post images, GL 3.3 classic texture slots, GL 4.3+ array/view descriptor candidates, disabled bindless fields, and an explicit fallback reason. Detailed metrics report `materialTable(...)` record, texture, class, missing-image, unsupported-feature, and fallback-reason counters, and `rendererMaterialResourceTableSelfTest` covers opaque, perforated, translucent, GUI, post, and missing-texture records.

Scene Packet V2 adds copied geometry and instance records to the packet stream. `GeometryResourceRecord` captures ambient/index buffer ids, cache offsets and byte ranges, vertex/index formats and counts, bounds, skinning/deform/upload classifications, and CPU index fallback provenance. `InstanceRecord` captures model and model-view matrices, previous matrix, entity color, shader-register ranges, palette offsets, and visibility flags for world, GUI, viewmodel, subview, remote-camera, render-demo, and bridge cases. Detailed metrics report geometry/instance record counts, record references, packet category counts, sort-key validation failures, and overflow causes, and `rendererGeometryResourceSelfTest` validates record copy, category classification, and overflow behavior.

`GLStateCache` is the central modern-state ownership point for program, VAO, buffer, texture, sampler, framebuffer, blend, depth, stencil, raster, viewport, scissor, and color-mask changes. It is invalidated explicitly when the backend hands control back to the legacy ARB2 renderer, so the modern diagnostic path never trusts state that ARB2 may have changed. `r_rendererMetrics 2` reports state-cache hits, misses, per-category misses, forced invalidations, and legacy handoff resets; `gfxInfo` reports debug-group/object-label availability and the latest cache state. Use `rendererGLStateCacheSelfTest` to exercise redundant state changes and legacy invalidation.

## Modern GL Executor Bring-Up

`r_rendererModernExecutor 1` enables the first modern-executor entry point. `r_rendererModernSubmit 1` additionally enables the first real GL 3.3 submission path, and `r_rendererModernVisible 1` opts into the guarded hybrid visible-frame bridge. After Phase 8 validation, `r_rendererModernAutoPromote 1` can request the same guarded visible path automatically only when `r_glTier auto`, `r_renderer best`, compatibility gates, executor readiness, ARB2 rollback availability, and the complete `r_rendererPromotionEvidence` token all pass:

- Requires the selected renderer tier to expose the GL 3.3 baseline feature set, including VAOs, UBOs, and buffer objects.
- Allocates a starter VAO and frame-constants UBO during OpenGL initialization.
- Compiles and reflects internal pass-specific shader variants for the supported GLSL tier matrix: 330, 410, 430, and 450 where the current context supports them.
- Consumes front-end `ScenePacket` and `RenderGraph` data every backend frame, with backend command-stream packetization retained only as a fallback.
- Builds a modern draw plan for depth, shadow-depth, flat-material, light-grid, and fog/blend packet categories, including shader-program selections, permutation/reflection metadata, fallback counts, and state-batch transition counts.
- Builds a modern submit plan from draw-plan entries with packet geometry/instance records, VBO-backed ambient vertex data, and either VBO-backed indices, frame-temp/generated index-cache blocks, or CPU indices that can be uploaded through `RendererUpload`.
- Caches a conservative visibility packet in each submit command, including projected screen bounds, depth range, frustum/screen rejection flags, near-plane fallback state, static/dynamic safety, Hi-Z candidacy, and shadow-caster participation. The executor consumes those packets for CPU frustum decisions, offscreen-scissor rejection, projected screen-space scissor tightening, and visibility metrics while keeping unsafe, dynamic, subview/viewmodel, and shadow-caster cases fail-open.
- Builds graph-owned Hi-Z depth pyramids through an explicit max-depth reduction program and executor-owned mip FBO instead of `glGenerateMipmap`, with the GL state cache handling framebuffer/texture state so the path avoids in-frame `glGetIntegerv` stalls.
- Applies a fit-for-purpose pipeline policy before expensive modern passes run: G-buffer, deferred, and forward+ execution are requested only when real submit-plan work or explicit debug-overlay work needs them, empty passes are counted and skipped, and modern visible composition can use a single completed lighting source without forcing an otherwise empty companion pass.
- Caches repeated G-buffer and forward+ framebuffer attachment layouts, reports cache hits versus attachment updates, keeps visible composition on known target FBO handles instead of hot-path state queries, and exposes the GL 3.3 CPU, GL 4.3 GPU-driven, and GL 4.5 low-overhead pipeline-fit contract through `gfxInfo` and detailed renderer metrics.
- On `GpuDrivenGL43` and higher tiers, allocates executor-owned submit-scene SSBO records, a validation SSBO, and a draw-indirect command buffer. The buffers are filled from the modern submit plan every backend frame; compute culls the submit records against visible/scissor input, validates the clustered-bin source count, compacts compatible indexed draws into indirect commands, and can read back GPU counters against a CPU reference when `r_rendererGpuValidation 1` is active.
- On `LowOverheadGL45` and higher tiers, uses direct-state-access buffer creation/subdata updates and multi-bind UBO/SSBO binding where the selected context exposes those entry points.
- Labels executor-owned buffers, programs, and the starter VAO when `KHR_debug` object labels are available, and wraps diagnostic submit/compute validation work in debug groups when supported.
- When `r_rendererModernSubmit 1` is active, binds the selected GLSL program, frame UBO, MVP uniform, scissor, ambient VBO, and index source through `GLStateCache`, then issues `glDrawElements` or `glDrawArrays` for ready commands. On GL 4.3+ validation frames, the GPU-driven path can also execute the generated indirect command range through masked `glMultiDrawElementsIndirect` for the first compatible batch signature.
- Masks color and depth writes during diagnostic submission, restores GL state afterward, and then lets ARB2 render the visible frame.
- When `r_rendererModernVisibleDepth 1` is active, clears graph-backed `sceneDepth` and `shadowMap` resources, submits conservative modern depth and compatible shadow-depth draws into those resources, accepts CPU-skinned depth, applies material alpha thresholds for safe perforated/alpha-tested depth, and keeps ARB2 in charge of final color output.
- When `r_rendererModernOpaque 1` is active, allocates graph-backed `gbufferAlbedo`, `gbufferNormal`, `gbufferMaterial`, and `gbufferEmissive` resources, binds them as a four-target MRT FBO with graph-owned `sceneDepth`, and submits conservative opaque/perforated/alpha-test G-buffer draws before ARB2 renders the final color frame.
- When `r_rendererModernDeferred 1` is active, resolves the graph-backed G-buffer subset into `deferredLight` by sampling albedo, normal, material, emissive/light-grid, scene depth, and the clustered-light UBO/SSBO buffers while ARB2 keeps visible color ownership.
- When `r_rendererForwardPlus 1` is active, writes graph-backed `sceneColor` through clustered forward+ opaque, alpha-test, and transparent/fog-blend pipelines that sample the clustered-light UBO/SSBO buffers and preserve transparent sort order while ARB2 keeps final frame ownership.
- When `r_rendererModernVisible 1` is active, it requests the depth, G-buffer, deferred-lite, forward+, modern-present, and ready fullscreen-GUI pieces together, then composes `deferredLight` plus `sceneColor` into graph-owned `hybridSceneColor` during the 3D view. That hybrid scene is handed to the current HDR scene target before SSAO, motion blur, bloom, tone mapping, and authored `_currentRender` post surfaces run, with graph `sceneDepth` blitted into the single-sample post depth target for depth-aware effects. Swap-time visible composition then becomes the LDR GUI/debug/present overlay step instead of repainting the scene over post output. It fails closed whenever authored special-effect, subview, remote-camera, render-demo, non-ready GUI packets, or unresolved stencil/shadow fallback lights are still legacy-owned.
- When the modern executor, opaque G-buffer bridge, deferred resolve, forward+ bridge, or clustered debug overlay is active, builds conservative per-scene clustered-light grids from `viewLight_t` lists, classifies point, projected, fog, ambient, and special lights, applies portal/area plus scissor coarse culling, chooses budgeted grid/reference limits from viewport and light pressure, records spill pressure for dense clusters, and uploads grid params, light records, and packed cluster references through GL 3.3 UBO fallback buffers or GL 4.3+ SSBO buffers.
- `r_rendererModernDepthDebug 1` overlays the graph-backed scene depth resource before swap; mode `2` overlays the shadow-depth resource when that pass executed.
- `r_rendererModernGBufferDebug` overlays the selected G-buffer attachment before swap for albedo, normal, material, or emissive/light-grid inspection.
- `r_rendererModernDeferredDebug` overlays deferred light contribution, cluster id, light-count heat, or fallback/overflow pressure before swap.
- `r_rendererClusterDebug` overlays clustered-light occupancy, light-count heatmap, or overflow pressure before swap.
- `r_shadowMapReport` and `gfxInfo` report the modern shadow plan: mapped, stencil-fallback, and skipped lights; projected/point/CSM counts; caster/receiver totals; atlas tile use, budgeted shadow size, pixels, update cadence, descriptor readiness, and unsupported-resource fallback reasons. Deferred resolve and forward+ consume the clustered shadow descriptor policy from that plan, but mapped lights whose modern receiver sampler is not production-ready are converted to per-light stencil fallbacks so visible-frame handoff rejects them instead of double-shadowing or silently dropping shadows.
- Keeps stencil shadows, deform surfaces, unsupported material classes, GPU-palette skinning, unsupported geometry, unavailable graph resources, unavailable MRT state, unsupported forward+ blend modes, GUI draws without ready packet/cache records, subview/post/special-effect packets, and alpha-test surfaces without a diffuse texture on the legacy path with explicit fallback counters.
- Reports prepared pass/draw coverage, shader-library readiness, draw-plan coverage, submit-plan readiness, pipeline demand/skipped-pass/FBO-cache/batch stability, cache-backed versus CPU-uploaded index counts, submitted draw/fallback counts, visible depth/shadow draw and fallback counts, G-buffer draw/fallback/bandwidth/MRT/overlay state, deferred resolve pixel/light/cluster-read/fallback/GPU-timer/overlay state, forward+ opaque/alpha/transparent/sort/fallback/overdraw/cluster-read/GPU-timer state, modern visible-frame composition/owner/fallback/resource/GPU-timer state, clustered-light grid/light/reference/shadow-descriptor/overflow/build/UBO/debug-overlay state, shadow-plan mapped/fallback/skipped/budget state, resource readiness, debug-overlay readiness, GL 4.3 GPU-driven resource/compute/indirect/readback/mismatch metrics, GL 4.5 DSA texture/FBO/sampler creation, named buffer/FBO updates, buffer/texture/sampler multi-bind usage, persistent-upload fence diagnostics, bindless experiment state, and GL state-cache hit/miss behavior through `gfxInfo` and `r_rendererMetrics 2`.

This gives the GL 3.3/4.1 executor a live object lifetime, frame-constant upload, packet-consumption, shader-library reflection, draw-plan generation, diagnostic GL submission, graph-backed depth and G-buffer resource execution, clustered-light preparation, shared shadow planning, deferred-lite resolve execution, clustered forward+ side-path execution, guarded hybrid visible-frame composition, conservative visibility packets, explicit max-depth Hi-Z construction, fit-for-purpose pass demand, fallback accounting, state-cache handoff safety, and metrics contract without replacing the stock Quake 4 color path by default. The GL 4.3 and GL 4.5 tiers are now active executor paths rather than capability labels: forced `r_glTier gl43` exercises SSBO-backed compute culling, clustered-bin validation, compacted indirect command generation, CPU-reference readback, and masked MDI execution, while forced `r_glTier gl45` additionally exercises DSA graph texture/FBO allocation, DSA sampler creation, named buffer/FBO updates, texture/sampler multi-bind groups, submit-batch compaction metrics, FBO attachment-cache diagnostics, and persistent-upload fence diagnostics. Driver quirk and compatibility gates now run before tier selection, so known broken UBO, MRT, timer-query, buffer-storage, and debug-context paths report deterministic fallback behavior in `gfxInfo`. Use `rendererModernGLExecutorSelfTest` to verify the analysis path, live GL object state, GPU-driven buffers, compute validation dispatch, Hi-Z reduction resources, and low-overhead binding path. Use `rendererModernVisibilitySelfTest` to verify conservative scissor/frustum/screen rejection, projected screen bounds, shadow-caster safety, the occlusion kill switch, Hi-Z candidate accounting, and no-query-stall policy. Use `rendererCompatibilityGatesSelfTest` to verify missing-feature downgrades, timer-query fallback, debug-context fallback, and synthetic driver-quirk table entries. Use `rendererGpuDrivenSelfTest` to verify GL 4.3 compute culling, generated indirect commands, CPU/GPU mismatch accounting, and masked multi-draw indirect execution. Use `rendererLowOverheadSelfTest` to verify GL 4.5 DSA resource allocation, DSA sampler setup, buffer/texture/sampler multi-bind, compacted batches, FBO attachment-cache hits, bindless experiment reporting, and upload fence diagnostics. Use `rendererVisiblePathSelfTest` to verify the visible-depth bridge, graph-backed scene/shadow resources, alpha-aware depth bindings, depth-overlay program, and conservative fallback contract. Use `rendererGBufferSelfTest` to verify graph-backed G-buffer resources, MRT setup, diffuse texture binding, packing assumptions, attachment bandwidth metrics, and G-buffer overlay readiness. Use `rendererClusterGridSelfTest` to verify light classification, cluster slicing, overflow accounting, UBO upload readiness, and debug-overlay texture generation. Use `rendererShadowPlannerSelfTest` to verify shadow-light policy, fallback accounting, budgeted map selection, render-graph shadow resource ownership, and clustered descriptor handoff. Use `rendererDeferredResolveSelfTest` to verify graph-backed deferred output, G-buffer/depth/cluster inputs, point/projected light accumulation, clustered shadow-policy consumption, light-grid contribution, fallback counters, and deferred overlay readiness. Use `rendererForwardPlusSelfTest` to verify graph-backed scene-color/depth resources, clustered forward opaque/alpha/transparent programs, transparent sort preservation, clustered-light and shadow-policy reads, and forward+ fallback counters. Use `rendererModernVisibleSelfTest` to verify the full guarded modern-visible sequence, pass-owner accounting, deferred/forward source readiness including single-source composition, hybrid scene target readiness, shadow-ready handoff, back-buffer copy, and fallback blocking. Use `rendererGLStateCacheSelfTest` to verify redundant-state suppression and legacy invalidation. Use `rendererShaderLibrarySelfTest` to verify the internal GLSL families, compact permutation keys, and reflected frame/resource bindings. Use `rendererModernGLDrawPlanSelfTest` to verify packet-to-plan classification against the current resource graph. Use `rendererModernGLSubmitPlanSelfTest` to verify submit-readiness classification, persistent/temp index-cache classification, CPU-index upload classification, and cache-fallback accounting.

## Modern Shader Library

The `ShaderLibrary` remains internal-only and does not replace ARB assembly or Raven-authored GLSL material programs. Shader Library V2 now compiles a controlled pass-oriented program family for every enabled GLSL tier:

- depth and shadow-depth variants for the first visible depth milestones
- transitional flat material, light-grid, fog/blend, GUI, and post-copy variants used by the current analysis path
- G-buffer opaque and alpha-tested variants for opt-in opaque material ownership
- deferred light resolve, clustered forward opaque, clustered forward alpha-tested, and transparent forward variants for hybrid lighting paths
- debug visualization variants for future resource and lighting inspection
- GLSL 330 baseline, plus 410/430/450 variants when the selected GL context supports them

Each linked program records its pass category, material class, compact `rendererPermutationKey_t`, reflected uniform locations, UBOs, SSBOs, samplers, images, attributes, and validated GLSL version. Shader compile/link diagnostics include the program name, pass, material class, GLSL tier, and permutation key. `gfxInfo` reports program/kind/permutation counts, per-version coverage, reload count, reflection totals, texture-program coverage, and readiness for every shader kind under `Modern GL shader library`. Dedicated `shader-library-gl33`, `shader-library-gl41`, `shader-library-gl43`, `shader-library-gl45`, and `shader-library-gl46` validation cases force the tier ladder and require the internal shader families to compile and reflect for every GLSL version supported by that context.

Runtime shader reload is intentionally debug-only. `rendererShaderLibraryReload` rebuilds the internal programs only when `r_rendererShaderReload 1` is set; otherwise it logs a skipped reload and leaves the existing library intact. Use `rendererShaderLibrarySelfTest` as the canonical self-test alias. `rendererModernGLShaderLibrarySelfTest` remains available for older scripts. Later milestones can promote these validated variants into visible depth, material, GUI, and post passes without introducing external shader assets or changing stock Quake 4 material behavior.

## Modern Draw Plan

The first modern draw-plan milestone is also internal-only. It consumes the packet frame and render graph after the shader library is ready, then emits executor-owned plan entries for packet categories that can be represented by the starter shader set:

- depth packets select the internal depth pipeline
- stencil-shadow and shadow-map packets select the internal shadow-depth pipeline
- ARB2 interaction and ambient packets select the internal flat-material pipeline, the G-buffer pipeline when `r_rendererModernOpaque`/G-buffer debug mode/`r_rendererModernVisible` is active and the material is in the conservative opaque or alpha-test subset, or clustered forward+ pipelines when `r_rendererForwardPlus`/`r_rendererModernVisible` is active for eligible non-deferred surfaces
- light-grid and fog/blend packets select their own internal shader variants, with eligible fog/blend packets promoted to the transparent forward+ pipeline when `r_rendererForwardPlus`/`r_rendererModernVisible` is active
- GUI packets select the internal GUI pipeline when their material, geometry, instance, and cache records are ready; special effects, authored post-process, render-target, copy-render, and other command-only packets remain explicit fallback categories until their visible parity is proven

Each plan entry records the source draw packet, pass category, shader kind, program handle, shader permutation, reflected MVP/debug/local/sampler bindings, material record index, geometry record index, instance record index, geometry counts, index/vertex-only mode, and GLSL variant. Metrics report planned draws, depth draws, material-family draws, fallback draws, missing material/geometry/instance records, state batches, program switches, material switches, and overflow status. The plan is deliberately prepare-first: it validates the modern submission shape while ARB2 continues to render the visible frame.

## Modern Submit Plan

The modern submit plan consumes the draw plan and derives the subset that is ready for a GL 3.3-style VAO/VBO indexed submission path:

- planned draws with copied geometry/instance records, VBO-backed ambient vertex caches, and VBO-backed index buffers become submit-ready commands
- generated or frame-temporary index caches now retain their element-buffer identity, so deformed, packed MD5R, packed light-interaction, and GLSL-prepared interaction paths can become cache-backed submit-ready commands instead of falling back to CPU-index upload
- planned draws with VBO-backed ambient vertex caches and CPU index arrays use `RendererUpload` for a frame-temp index buffer
- draws missing modern-safe vertex data or any usable index source remain explicit fallback draws
- the plan records program, vertex-buffer, index-buffer, scissor, and material batch transitions
- the plan records per-draw uniform-update pressure, the single frame-UBO bind, CPU-index upload pressure, and submitted/fallback counts

With `r_rendererModernSubmit 0`, this still answers “how much of this frame could a modern GL submitter draw today?” With `r_rendererModernSubmit 1`, it also executes those ready commands before ARB2 while color/depth writes are disabled. ARB2 still renders the frame.

## Compatibility Bridge

The active visible renderer remains ARB2 by default. The modern executor is still opt-in; when `r_rendererModernSubmit 1` is enabled it can issue masked diagnostic GL draws before ARB2, and when `r_rendererModernVisible 1` is enabled it may own a controlled hybrid frame only if all required pass owners are modern-safe. The new scaffolding deliberately wraps existing behavior:

- `RendererBootstrap` owns selected tier/features and marks the ARB2 bridge.
- `RenderGraph` builds ordered packet-pass nodes from the front-end scene-packet frame and attaches virtual resource edges for current legacy depth, color, post-process, GUI, and present work.
- `RenderGraphResources` turns graph resource records into stable imported or transient GL handles, owns transient texture/FBO allocation and validation, tracks lifetimes and conservative aliasing, and reports graph resource state without changing visible output.
- `MaterialResourceTable` turns packet material records into stable table records with texture/sampler descriptors and explicit fallback reasons, so modern draw plans can carry a material table id forward instead of treating the legacy material pointer as submit-time state.
- `ScenePacket`, `DrawPacket`, `PassPacket`, `MaterialResourceRecord`, `GeometryResourceRecord`, and `InstanceRecord` define the backend-neutral packet contract. `RenderWorld` and GUI producers emit draw-view packets before the legacy command queue reaches the backend; command-only passes such as render-target, copy, special-effect, and present operations are tracked alongside them, and the backend command-stream translator is kept as a survival fallback. ARB2 still executes the original commands for visible output.
- `ModernGLExecutor` owns the opt-in GL 3.3+ executor shell, validates packet/graph coverage, keeps Shader Library V2 alive, updates a frame-constants UBO, optionally performs masked diagnostic GL submission, optionally writes graph-backed scene/shadow depth resources through `r_rendererModernVisibleDepth`, optionally writes graph-backed opaque G-buffer resources through `r_rendererModernOpaque`, optionally resolves that G-buffer into graph-owned `deferredLight` through `r_rendererModernDeferred`, optionally writes clustered forward+ opaque/alpha/transparent side-path output through `r_rendererForwardPlus`, optionally composes a modern visible frame through `r_rendererModernVisible`, replays ready fullscreen GUI draw packets through a modern GUI overlay after composition, inventories post/copy/subview/render-demo/BSE categories with explicit modern-owner or compatibility-fallback accounting, promotes GL 4.3+ tiers into live SSBO/compute/indirect culling and generated-command work with CPU-reference validation, promotes GL 4.5+ tiers into DSA buffer/FBO/sampler updates and buffer/texture/sampler multi-bind, and leaves mixed/unsupported visible color execution on the ARB2 bridge.
- `ModernClusteredLighting` builds conservative CPU light-cluster grids from packet-scene `viewLight_t` lists, uploads grid/light/index records through GL 3.3 UBOs or GL 4.3+ SSBOs for hybrid-lighting shaders, tracks uploaded/spilled/hard-overflow references separately, and exposes `r_rendererClusterDebug` occupancy, count, and overflow overlays without changing final lighting.
- `ModernShadowPlanner` builds the shared per-frame shadow policy from packet-scene lights, applies the current shadow-map contract and renderer budget, records mapped/stencil-fallback/skipped decisions with caster/receiver cost data, fills matrix/atlas/depth/compare/bias/filter/scissor descriptor fields, and feeds descriptor indices and fallback policy into clustered light records for deferred and forward+ receiver work.
- `GLStateCache` owns modern-side GL state binding suppression and records explicit invalidations before ARB2 resumes control.
- `ModernGLDrawPlan` translates eligible packet/graph categories into executor-owned depth, shadow-depth, flat-material, G-buffer, clustered forward+, light-grid, fog/blend, and GUI draw-plan entries with Shader Library V2 selections, compact permutation metadata, reflected bindings, material/geometry/instance record ids, and state-batch metrics, while explicit fallback categories stay on the legacy path.
- `ModernGLSubmitPlan` translates draw-plan entries into submit commands from copied geometry and instance records when the legacy vertex cache exposes VBO-backed ambient buffers and either VBO-backed, frame-temp, generated, or CPU-uploadable index data, carries shader-kind/reflection metadata forward, and records missing-buffer fallback reasons for the GL3 executor.
- `RendererUpload` owns static vertex/index buffer uploads, the feature-gated dynamic frame-temp stream, GL 4.5 persistent mapped defaulting with fence-retirement diagnostics, and the old vertex-cache path as a fallback.

Use `gfxInfo` to inspect the selected tier, context profile, feature flags, capability summary, driver quirk report, compatibility gates, default-promotion state, benchmark preset/threshold state, GPU-timer availability, scene-packet limits/source reporting, geometry/instance record limits, resource-graph limits, render-graph resource ownership, material resource-table readiness, modern-executor availability, visible-depth resource/debug-overlay state, G-buffer resource/MRT/debug-overlay state, deferred resolve resource/debug-overlay state, forward+ resource/program/cluster/draw/fallback state, modern visible-frame owner/composition/fallback state, modern compatibility inventory state, clustered-light UBO/debug-overlay state, modern shadow-plan policy/budget/fallback state, GL state-cache/debug-label status, Shader Library V2 status, draw-plan coverage, submit-plan readiness, GL 4.3 GPU-driven resource/validation/indirect status, GL 4.5 DSA/multi-bind/bindless-experiment status, and upload stream/fence diagnostics.

The automated safe validation matrix lives in [renderer-validation-matrix.md](renderer-validation-matrix.md) and can be run with:

```powershell
python tools\tests\renderer_validation_matrix.py
```

The runner covers startup, `gfxInfo`, forced `r_glTier` probes, debug-context fallback, presentation cvar probes, compatibility-gate diagnostics, default-promotion diagnostics, benchmark diagnostics, performance-regression thresholds, clustered-light diagnostics, deferred-resolve diagnostics, forward+ diagnostics, modern-visible diagnostics, modern compatibility diagnostics, GPU-driven diagnostics, shader-library tier coverage, and all renderer foundation self-tests without entering gameplay. The opt-in gameplay runner owns map-loading evidence for required SP/MP scenes, presentation profiles, shadow profiles, and campaign transition checks.

Gameplay and benchmark evidence now has a separate opt-in runner:

```powershell
python tools\tests\renderer_gameplay_benchmark.py --profile smoke
python tools\tests\renderer_gameplay_benchmark.py --profile required
python tools\tests\renderer_gameplay_benchmark.py --profile tiers
python tools\tests\renderer_gameplay_benchmark.py --profile presentation
python tools\tests\renderer_gameplay_benchmark.py --profile shadows
```

That harness launches from `.install`, enters the required SP/MP maps, waits for the active gameplay draw through `g_autoExecAfterMapLoad`, enables metrics only for the capture window, captures screenshots, dumps `rendererBenchmarkCapture`, `framePacingSnapshot`, and `gfxInfo`, optionally compares deterministic TGA references, and fails on renderer overflow/idStr/shader/link/fatal markers. The manual sections of the matrix remain the release sign-off source for human visual review, RenderDoc tier captures, long-run `vid_restart`/map-transition loops, and target-hardware performance claims.
