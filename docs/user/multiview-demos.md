# Demo Library, Playback, and Multi-View Demos

Multi-view demos are server-side multiplayer recordings. One `.mvd` file
contains the full match state across every active multiplayer instance instead
of only the camera seen by the person who started recording, so playback can
switch between active players or use a free camera.

openQ4 also has one **Demos** library for native MVDs, openQ4 render demos,
developer command demos, unsupported retail recordings, and incomplete files.
Choose **Demos** on the main menu, or enter `demoMenu` in the console. The
browser can filter **All**, **Multi-view**, **Render**, **Legacy**, and
**Incomplete** entries and shows the detected type, map, date, duration, and
playback status.

Only controls supported by the selected format are enabled. A loose file in
your save-path `demos/` directory can be deleted after confirmation;
package-backed demos are read-only.

## Record a match

Host a multiplayer server map, then use:

```text
recordMVD match_name
```

Omit the name to use an unused `mvd` filename. Recordings are written under the
current save path in `baseoq4/demos/`.

Stop cleanly with:

```text
stopMVD
```

openQ4 records to a `.mvd.part` file first. A clean stop adds the end marker and
renames it to `.mvd`. If the game or machine stops unexpectedly, the partial
file stays clearly marked and the last good data is not mistaken for a
complete demo.

The familiar Quake 4 names `recordNetDemo`, `stopNetDemo`, and `playNetDemo`
are aliases for this system. The files are still `.mvd`; openQ4 does not
pretend they are legacy `.netdemo` files.

## Inspect and play

Validate a recording and print its format, duration, record counts, and clean
end status:

```text
mvdInfo match_name
```

Play it with:

```text
playMVD match_name
```

You can instead select the file in **Demos** and choose **Play**. A compact
overlay shows the current time, duration, speed, and view. Press Escape to open
the interactive playback controls; playback pauses while the menu is open and
resumes on close only if it was running beforehand.

The controls include:

- pause/resume and single-frame step;
- -30, -10, +10, and +30 second skips;
- 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, and 4x speed presets;
- **Follow next** and **Free roam** for MVDs;
- stop and close.

While watching an MVD, attack also follows the next active player and jump
leaves follow mode. Normal movement and look controls move the free camera.

### Playback console commands

These commands work through the common playback controller when the active
format supports the action:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `demoPause [0\|1]` | Toggle pause, or pause/resume explicitly. |
| `demoSpeed <0.05-16>` | Set a playback speed beyond the menu presets if needed. |
| `demoSeek <seconds>` | Go to an absolute time from the start. |
| `demoSkip <seconds>` | Move by a signed interval, such as `demoSkip -10`. |
| `demoStep` | Pause and advance one frame. |
| `demoFollow` | Follow the next player in an MVD. |
| `demoFreeRoam` | Leave MVD follow mode for free flight. |
| `demoStop` | Stop the active demo. |

MVD-only equivalents remain available: `mvdPause`, `mvdSpeed`, `mvdSeek`,
`mvdSkip`, `mvdStep`, `mvdFollowNext`, and `mvdFreeRoam`. Use `stopMVD` to
stop MVD recording or playback.

## What each format can do

| Format | Playback | Seeking and speed | Camera |
|---|---|---|---|
| openQ4 MVD `.mvd` 1.0-1.2 | Supported, including API-39 1.0/1.1 recordings | Pause, speed, step, and replay-based seek | Full-world free roam and player follow |
| openQ4 render `.demo` | Supported | Pause, speed, step, and replay-based seek | Fixed recorded camera |
| Retail Quake 4 render `.demo` | Not supported yet | None | Not available |
| Retail Quake 4 `.netdemo` | Not supported yet | None | Not available |
| Command `.cdemo` | Developer best effort | Play/stop only | Determined by the recorded simulation |
| `.mvd.part`, `.part`, `.ucmd` | Incomplete; not playable | None | None |

A render demo stores the recorded renderer, sound, and GUI presentation, not a
complete multiplayer world. It therefore cannot provide genuine free roam or
player following. Rewinding restarts it and silently replays its commands to
the requested time in cooperative per-frame batches. The seeking overlay is
shown before restart work begins; a single indivisible map load or renderer
command can still take longer than the configured budget. Starting another
seek simply retargets that replay.

Retail Quake 4 `.demo` and `.netdemo` files use different stream/protocol
formats. The library identifies them as legacy and leaves **Play** disabled
instead of risking an incorrect decoder. Early openQ4 render demos remain
supported when their decoded stream can be verified, including historical
`OpenQ4 RDEMO` and openQ4-authored `Quake4 RDEMO` wrappers.

Supported historical openQ4 render demos are decoded defensively. If a
renderer or sound command, hash string, index, or top-level token is truncated
or malformed, playback closes the file and returns to the menu with a warning
instead of terminating openQ4.

`.cdemo` files are unversioned developer command logs whose consistency
depends on the matching engine and game build. They are not portable match
archives. openQ4 structurally preflights them before enabling Play and rejects
truncated or malformed files without entering their recorded map.

## Recording limits

These archived settings make unattended server recording safer:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `mvd_snapshotDelay` | `50` | Milliseconds between full-world snapshots. |
| `mvd_maxSnapshotMB` | `4` | Maximum uncompressed size of one snapshot. |
| `mvd_maxSizeMB` | `1024` | Maximum file size in MiB; `0` disables the limit. |
| `mvd_maxDurationMinutes` | `360` | Maximum recording duration; `0` disables the limit. |
| `mvd_enforceContent` | `1` | Refuse playback when declarations/content differ. |
| `mvd_seekBudgetMS` | `12` | Maximum replay-seek work per displayed frame. |
| `demo_renderSeekBudgetMS` | `10` | Cooperative render-demo replay budget checked between stream commands. |

Lowering the snapshot delay increases temporal detail and file size. The
50 ms default matches the normal multiplayer snapshot interval.

## MVD versions, seeking, and damaged files

The MVD container has its own version, required-feature negotiation, per-record
versions, bounded lengths, and checksums. A newer openQ4 can remain compatible
with older recordings when their game schema and snapshot protocol are still
supported.

MVD 1.0 contains the checked match stream without a timeline index. MVD 1.1
adds an optional sparse timeline index containing the first snapshot,
approximately one entry per second, and the final snapshot while leaving the
required record layouts unchanged. MVD 1.2 is the current writer: it records
networked entities from every active multiplayer instance and preserves
instance-only reliable and positional effects. Its reliable and snapshot
records have a new version, while the reader retains the version-1 decoder used
by 1.0 and 1.1.

The current reader accepts all three versions and reconstructs a timeline by
scanning checked snapshots when the index is absent. A valid 1.1 or 1.2 index
also lets the browser obtain duration and count information without first
scanning the whole match. A clean recording that ends before its first
scheduled snapshot legitimately has no index and a zero snapshot count; it
remains playable when its initialization and end marker are otherwise valid.

The index does not turn delta snapshots into independent save points. Forward
seeks replay records quickly from the current position. Rewinding resets the
recorded map and initial state, then replays from the start in bounded chunks;
the overlay shows **Seeking...** while that work is in progress. Long demos can
therefore take longer to rewind, but the same safe fallback works for MVD 1.0
through 1.2.

Formats 1.0 and 1.1 keep their original exact game-API compatibility check.
Format 1.2 uses a separately versioned MVD game schema, allowing future game
updates to retain demo compatibility without pretending every game API change
is interchangeable. Required feature bits ensure a 1.2 file cannot claim
full-world instance support while omitting the data needed to provide it.

Playback stops safely when:

- the container major is unsupported;
- a required future feature or record is unknown;
- the network snapshot protocol is incompatible;
- the legacy game API or current MVD game schema is incompatible;
- the simulation rate differs;
- the content/declaration checksum differs;
- map state attempts to restore a cvar that is not network-synchronized;
- a record is truncated or fails its checksum.

Playback also limits how many records may be consumed while finding the
initial map state and in any one displayed frame. These internal ceilings keep
a valid long match smooth while preventing a damaged stream from causing an
unbounded startup or frame stall.

`mvd_enforceContent 0` bypasses only the content checksum for diagnostics. It
cannot make genuinely incompatible assets or declarations replay correctly.
