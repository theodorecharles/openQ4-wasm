===============================================================================

	Persistent Vulkan device + swapchain context (Phase C,
	docs/dev/plans/2026-07-17-vulkan-phase-c.md).

	Owns the instance, surface (created through the engine's window
	services), physical/logical device, queues, VMA allocator, swapchain,
	and the frames-in-flight synchronization. Phase C drives it to an
	animated clear; later phases attach the real draw path.
